# Aztarok Dev Log

### Made auth with Supabase and can redirect users out of protected pages, but there are no pages that need to be protected yet.

## 12/11/24:

### Commit 1: Added Shadcn Button and Input components. Created a Navbar where it can detect if a user is logged in or not. Plus the navbar can redirect to the profile page and auth pages and can sign users out.
### Commit 2: Used the Shadcn components to create login and sign up forms. The forms are also changed based on the route in the auth group layout.tsx automatically.
### Commit 3: Fixed README
